## How to Play
### Make Choices

Choices affect the way the game will turn out so choose carefully. You will be prompted to enter a number for a specific choice selection or you will be prompted to enter custom words. Read the options carefully before choosing. Additionally, "yes" and "no" should be typed in lower case letters.
